# Lending club case study
Lending Club, a leading online loan marketplace, faces two key risks when evaluating loan applications: losing business by rejecting applicants likely to repay, or incurring financial losses by approving risky applicants who may default. The primary objective is to reduce credit losses by identifying strong indicators of default from applicant profiles. Understanding these driver variables can help the company make informed loan approval decisions, minimizing potential credit loss while maximizing profitable opportunities.

## General Information
The goal of this exercise is to assist Lending Club in minimizing credit losses by addressing two key challenges:

Ensuring the approval of applicants likely to repay their loans is crucial for generating revenue through interest payments. Failing to approve such applicants results in missed business opportunities.

On the other hand, approving loans for high-risk applicants who may default can lead to substantial financial losses for the company.
